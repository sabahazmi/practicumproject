# RAPID TECHNIQUE USING RADIOLOGICAL IMAGES TO PREDICT BRAIN TUMOUR

#### Summary:
This GitHub repository presents a project focused on the detection of brain tumors using deep learning techniques. The project aims to improve the accuracy and efficiency of brain tumor diagnosis through the application of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on MRI scans.

The project begins with an introduction to the background of the University Sains Malaysia (USM) and the domain of brain tumor detection. It highlights the importance of early detection and accurate diagnosis in improving patient outcomes. The problem statement addresses the challenges associated with brain tumor detection, including limited data, manual segmentation processes, and the need for rapid predictions.

The research questions are formulated to guide the project, such as the conversion of DICOM files into a format suitable for machine learning models, rapid tumor prediction for surgeons, and the impact of glioma prediction on robust diagnosis. The objectives of the project are also outlined, including the use of public datasets to augment the available data, the development of a deep learning-based framework for tumor detection, and testing the model's performance on USM's dataset.

The conclusion summarizes the achievements of the project, highlighting the successful answer to the research questions and the fulfillment of the objectives. It emphasizes the effectiveness of deep learning models in predicting brain tumors, the conversion of DICOM files using Pydicom, and the potential for improved diagnosis through rapid and accurate predictions. Additionally, the conclusion mentions the lessons learned, particularly in communication skills and overcoming initial difficulties in understanding deep learning.

The future scope and opportunities section suggests avenues for further improvement, including adding more data for training, exploring different models and transfer learning techniques, and considering further academic or professional endeavors in the field of deep learning.

Overall, this GitHub repository provides a comprehensive overview of a brain tumor detection project using deep learning, offering valuable insights, code, and resources for researchers, practitioners, and enthusiasts interested in medical imaging and machine learning applications in healthcare.
